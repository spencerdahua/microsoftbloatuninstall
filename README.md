# microsoftbloatuninstall
uninstall script for some bloatware.
This uninstalls various gross, bloated software from Microsoft's Windows 10 versions using Powershell.
If you have anything to add to the script or any suggestions, please, please, please add it as an issue/pull request.
I'd love for my script to be added onto or improved.
